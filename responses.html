  Answer: Unfortunately we can not add this because there would be a large security breach. Sorry. However, we may figure out how to in the future.
4. basketbros on crazy games
  Answer: I've got you. Custom coded so harder to be blocked <a href="https://basketbros-flixo.vercel.app/">play here</a>
5. more duck life games
  already added 5, which were hard to find
6. Add pokemon games like pokemon fire red and pokemon randomizers
  I'll try to convince one of our partners to give me some
7. Please add drift hunters
  I really love that game too, so I'll try harder than usual. I can't find one so far because the school has disabled JavaScript in our browsers which is what is used to build it.
8. The movie link doesn't work.
  yeah, that was my unblocked movie site from last year and I eventually realized it was broken, sorry. More movies coming soon (hopefully)
9. When you go to different sections on the website it stops cloaking it.
  it would be really hard for me to fix, I would have to try to find another developer or steal some code of GitHub, but for now it will do that.

Thank you all for helping make Flixo a better place.
